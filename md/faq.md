### What is Slock.it potential market?

### Slock的潜在市场是什么？

Anywhere where there are underused assets such as parked cars, parking slots or temporarily vacant apartments, there is an entrepreneur who can make a profit using SLock.it. Our solution enables both consumers and businesses to turn these assets into income. Almost anything can be retrofitted with a Slock: homes, offices, power tools, bicycles, household electronics, cars, motorcycles and of course lockers.
无论哪里存在没有被利用的资产，例如  或者临时性的闲置公寓，企业家就可以利用Slock.it从中赚到利润。我们的解决使得消费者和商家都可以将这些资产变成收入。几乎任何东西都可以用Slock进行改造：房屋、办公室、电力、工具、自行车、家用电器、汽车、摩托车，当然还有锁。

The sharing economy has created [17](http://venturebeat.com/2015/06/04/the-sharing-economy-has-created-17-billion-dollar-companies-and-10-unicorns/) different billion-dollar companies with 60,000 employees. The sector has received close to $15 billion in funding so far and its global yearly revenue is projected to reach $335 billion by 2025 (source: [PWC](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/technology/publications/assets/pwc-consumer-intelligence-series-the-sharing-economy.pdf)).
共享经济已经创造了[17](http://venturebeat.com/2015/06/04/the-sharing-economy-has-created-17-billion-dollar-companies-and-10-unicorns/)个价值10亿美元以上的企业，员工超过60000名。到目前为止这个领域已经收到近150亿美元的投资，到2025年全球每年分享经济行业的收入将高达3350亿美元(来源: [PWC](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/technology/publications/assets/pwc-consumer-intelligence-series-the-sharing-economy.pdf))

We believe that very soon, cars will be available for rent in the streets of every city, Airbnbs will be fully automated, and small business owners will prefer to rent private work spaces on demand rather than commit to complex leases. Owners in a sharing economy become both consumers and producers, leveraging Slocks to earn an income without losing revenue to any third party.
我们相信，汽车很快将在每一个城市街道上被出租，Airbnb将完全自动化运营，小商家将更喜欢按需租用私有工作场地，而不是复杂的租赁。分享经济中的所有者既是消费者也是生产者，利用Slock专区收入，同时不会 

The millennials' philosophy is fast becoming "If you can rent it, why own it". 66% of the world is willing to share or rent their personal assets for financial gain, and that figure is as high as [94%](http://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/nielsenglobal/apac/docs/reports/2014/Nielsen-Global-Share-Community-Report.pdf) in China. We believe Slock.it is uniquely placed to address those needs worldwide, today.
千禧年一代的信奉的哲学很快变成了“如果你可以租，为什么要买”。全世界66%的人乐意分享或者出租他们个人资产，赚取收益，这个比例在中国更是高达[94%](http://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/nielsenglobal/apac/docs/reports/2014/Nielsen-Global-Share-Community-Report.pdf)。我们相信Slock.it正是为解决这些需求而生的。


### Who are Slock.it's potential partners?

### 谁是Slock的潜在合作伙伴？

We are currently reaching out to a number of partners, in particular:
目前，我们正在与一些合作伙伴进行沟通，特别是以下领域的合作伙伴：

- Sharing economy insurance providers
- Manufacturers of smart locks for the home and offices
- Manufacturers of electronic bike locks
- Real estate companies investing in smart homes
- Hotels and BnBs
- Other Ethereum and cryptocurrency businesses
- 分享经济保险服务提供商
- 生产住宅和办公室智能锁生产商
- 自行车电子锁生产商
- 投资智能家庭的房地产公司
- 酒店和BnB
- 其它以太坊和密码学货币项目


### Is Slock.it open source?

### Slock开源吗？

If Slock.it GmbH is selected as the first service provider for the DAO, we will make all the code, the smart contracts, user interfaces, mobile apps, and everything forming the Slock.it DAO free and open source, for anyone to use and re-purpose. We'll not only make these things public, we'll also do everything in our power to see companies other than us develop Slock.it compatible products, as we are keen to see the ecosystem grow beyond what we started.
如果Slock.it GmbH被选为DAO（去中心化自治组织）的第一个服务提供商，那么我们将开源所有的代码，包括智能合约、用户界面、移动应用和构成Slock.it DAO的所有组件，任何人都可以使用这些代码，将这些代码应用到其它项目。我们不仅将公开这些代码，我们也将尽我们所能让其它公司开发与Slock.it兼容的产品，我们非常渴望看到整个生态系统繁荣起来。


### What's in it for Slock.it GmbH then?
### 那么

Slock.it GmbH will put forward a proposal to become the DAO's service provider at the end of the token presale. Slock.it GmbH is a for profit company, and the DAO will hopefully become one of its clients. It's critical for us to see aligned incentives between the DAO and our company, so you can expect a symbiotic relationship - what we will work on privately will also benefit the Slock.it ecosystem as a whole. For example, Slock.it GmbH could engage in partnerships with lock manufacturers, consult for real estate companies building smart homes, integrate the Slock.it API at part of popular smart objects, work with banks for Slocks to accept FIAT payments, etc. 
Slock.it GmbH是一家盈利性公司，DAO将成为Slock.it GmbH的客户之一。  例如，Slock.it GmbH可以与锁生产商达成合作伙伴关系，为开发智能家庭的房地产公司提供咨询，将Slock.it API（应用程序接口）与流行的智能产品整合，与银行合作，是的Slock可以接受法币支付等。

## How it works

## Slock是如何运行的？

### What are 'Slocks'?

### Slock是什么？

'Slock' is a porte-manteau of 'Smart, Safe and Secure Lock'. Any object supporting ZigBee, Z-Wave, Bluetooth LE or Wi-Fi can already be used as a Slock thanks to our first product, the Ethereum Computer. When it comes to powering up a ‘dumb’ object, it will just be a case of retrofitting it using smart plugs. Slocks will also come in many shapes and sizes: bike locks, car locks and door locks are already being explored through partnerships with IoT manufacturers.
Slock是


### How do Slocks work?

### Slock的工作机制是什么？

The owner of a Slock sets a deposit amount and a price for using the item. A user can find the Slock and its price using the mobile app then make a payment on the Ethereum blockchain, thereby gaining permission to open or close that Slock.

A deposit is held as collateral in a smart contract until the user returns the item. The smart contract is automatically enforced, with the deposit returned to the user minus the cost of the rental, which in turn will be automatically disbursed to the owner of the Slock.

All of this happens without any assistance from any third-party. 


### Will users have to pay every time they use a Slock?

### 用户每次使用Slock时必须进行支付吗？

They won't have to, only renting access to the lock costs money. Any current user (which could also include the owner) sends [Whisper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Whisper-Overview)-signed messages (which do not cost anything) to open or close the door.


### Will users be able to use a debit or credit card to open a Slock?

### 用户能够使用借记卡或者信用卡打开Slock吗？

We're currently approaching various financial institutions to try and make this a reality.


### Aren't the Slocks going to get vandalized?

Slock不会被人恶意破坏吗？

Of course some will, as Slocks aren't a panacea for theft or damage. What Slocks can do that traditional locks cannot, is provide an insurance option 'baked' into the usage contract. The first implementation of this insurance will be setting a deposit, which in the case of items that are too cumbersome to transport - or are of a low enough value - will work quite well. A more complex future implementation will include a link to a sharing economy insurance contract, something we are currently working on with partners.


### What happens if there is no power or Internet?

### 如果断电或者断网时，Slock会发生什么？

The same thing that would happen if any other smart lock was employed: some will 'fail secure' while others will 'fail safe'. Which mode of operation is used is not determined by the Slock DAO, but instead by the use case and local regulation. For example, fire rated and hotel room doors will probably 'fail safe' while a locker will certainly 'fail secure').




## The Product

## 产品

### What exactly is the "Ethereum Computer"?

### “以太坊计算机”究竟是什么？

It’s the easiest entry point to the world of Ethereum, without having to struggle setting up a client, buying ether from an exchange or worrying about security updates.

The Ethereum computer is a tiny, preinstalled, preconfigured home server running both an optimized Ethereum node and exciting new decentralised applications, including Mist. The Ethereum Computer is putting identity, funds and personal information back under the users’ control, and we think it’s going to change _everything_.

Think of a little box that manages your permissions and identity, with strong encryption and permission control. Inside you’ll find a web3 identity vault, a Slock gateway to your IoT, and even experimental software like an IPFS server to rent your unused hard drive space — automatically.

- It’s the easier way to browse Dapps.
- It’s a secure gatekeeper between the web & web3 to your home or small office IoT, communicating wirelessly with your smart objects.
- And it’s also a brilliant development platform, packaging all the software needed to build Ethereum Dapps as part of a straightforward, optimized image.


### What could I do with the Ethereum Computer?

### 我能用以太坊计算机做什么？

- Enable your entire home to communicate with the blockchain: rent your flat, or share any Slock.it enabled smart object directly and securely.
- Try out new, exciting applications: The Ethereum Computer is a full blown implementation of the Ethereum stack, and therefore can serve any Dapp via HDMI out to your home theater.
- Browse web3 securely: you can simply point your browser, mobile phone or tablet to the Ethereum Computer, and the 3rd party web servers will only be used to serve static HTML assets, while your precious keys will safely stay within the confines of your home.
- Participate in experimental programs: the Ethereum Computer can be used to run an IPFS node, perhaps even receiving rewards for renting your unused hard drive space.
- Develop applications with Ethereum and never have to worry about installation difficulties. We’ll sort out updates and compatibility issues between the various components of the Ethereum 'stack' (Whisper, EVM, Web3.js, Swarm, etc), and will push updates only when we have tested the framework top to bottom.
- Help secure the Ethereum network and get rewarded for it (once Ethereum has switched to PoS), without having to dedicate larger, more expensive and less secure equipment to that task.


### Will it be hackable/open?

### 以太坊计算机是开放

Absolutely. We'll not only make the devkit images publicly available, but also all of the detailed code that went into building the 'stack' so you can modify/improve on the installation. One thing we're aiming to do is use a hardware (board+SoC) combination that is commercially available so that one could completely rebuild the Ethereum Computer from scratch if they wanted to. Having some GPIO available will also allow anyone to connect wired objects to the Ethereum network. We want you to be able to experiment!


### When will the Ethereum Computer become available for sale?

#### 以太坊计算机什么时候开始销售？

Sometime in 2017, although we anticipate devkits much earlier as part of an iterative development process.


### Will it be useful for mining?

### 以太坊计算机能用来挖矿吗？

The Ethereum Computer is a full Ethereum client and therefore perfectly capable to have its mining function enabled. That said, it would not be a good platform to mine on while Ethereum is still using proof of work, as its form factor prevents it from having the hashing power GPUs have. The Ethereum Computer will be a perfectly appropriate platform to help secure the network, but only once Ethereum switches to proof of stake.




## The Presale

## Slock代币预售


### When is the Slock token presale?

### Slock代币什么时候开始预售？

It will take place at the beginning of 2016 and will last roughly two months. Further details will be released soon. 


### Why do a Slock token presale?

### 为什么做Slock代币预售？

We're using smart contracts build on the Ethereum blockchain so people all over the world can be empowered to build a new future for the sharing economy, and in exchange for their early help, they will receive a reward in the form of Slock tokens which holds many benefits.

In order to keep governance fair and decentralized, a DAO will be created so that the funds held by the sharing community will never be centrally managed. A small fee representing the cost of decentralization is taken from each Slock transaction not paid in Slock tokens and returned to the DAO, giving it an option to reinvest the profits to support its growth.

Slock tokens holders will be able to vote on important decisions relating to the management of the DAO, including redistributing profits amongst Slock token holders. 


### What are Slock tokens?

### Slock代币是什么？

Slock tokens allows the holders to:

- Vote on important issues in the DAO 
- Open or close Slocks without having to pay a fee to the DAO
- Trade them peer to peer or on exchanges
- If voted by the DAO, get access to a portion of the profits generated by Slocks, proportionally to how many tokens they hold


### What if users want to own a Slock outright?

It's possible, by paying a one-time deployment fee to the DAO. This will remove the per-use fee. Note that the amount in question will be determined by the DAO itself as it engages with the service provider.


### Can I mine Slock tokens?

### 我能够通过挖矿获得Slock代币吗？

No. Slock tokens are used purely to represent the proportion of votes a Slock token holder is entitled to as part of the DAO. If you would like to mine something, try [ether](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Mining).


### Will I be able to send, receive and exchange Slock tokens?

### 我能够发生、接收和交易Slock代币吗？

Yes, there will be functions build in the smart contract to send/receive Slock tokens and peer to peer exchange will be possible from day one. 


### Will I need to be a programmer to purchase tokens?

### 购买代币需要我成为一个程序员吗？

No, we want to be inclusive every step of the way so that as many people as possible can participate in this new sharing community. The purchase process will be done entirely online via a simple website. If you already have an ether wallet, you'll be able to use that, or the site will just generate a wallet for you.
 

### Will anyone hold 'premined' tokens?

### 有人持有“预挖的”代币吗？

No. No one will get an unfair advantage: the only tokens in circulation will be the ones purchased during the Slock token presale.


### Will there be another opportunity to purchase tokens?

### 还有另一次购买代币的机会吗？

There will be only one Slock token presale. Once launched during the course of 2016, the Slock DAO will be fully autonomous and decentralized. How it then manages itself, including decisions on its finances, is entirely up to 'it'. Slock token holders will hold voting rights, be able to submit proposals, and pass motions.


### How will the DAO control the funds it receives during the presale?

### 在预售期间，DAO9（去中心化自治组织）如何控制它收到的资金？

The Slock token holders will elect the service provider of their choosing, and the conditions under which funds are distributed. These decisions are entirely governed by smart contracts, and accessible through a simple online interface.


### Is there a minimum goal for the presale?

### 代币预售有最小

Yes. A minimum of 700,000 ether (equivalent) is required to build a meaningful DAO and first product. If the minimum is not reached, participants in the presale will be able to get their funds back (denominated in ether).


### Will the presale accept Bitcoin, Doge, etc.?

### 代币预售接受比特币、狗币等密码学货币吗？

Yes, we have partnered with Shapeshift so that the Slock token presale will accept most cryptocurrencies in existence, including Ether, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Doge, Maidsafe, StorjcoinX, Bitshares, BitUSD, Nxt, Dash, Clams and many, many others.


### Will the Slock token presale accept FIAT currencies?

### 代币预售接受法币吗？

Not directly. In order to take part, you must use a cryptocurrency. To exchange FIAT for cryptocurrencies you could use an exchange such as [Kraken](https://kraken.com).




## The DAO

## DAO（去中心化自治组织）

### DA.. what?

### DAO是什么？

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a form of company which operates entirely on the blockchain. In our case, the DAO is made up of Slock token holders that can review proposals and cast their votes to elect and direct a service provider which will represent them in the physical world. This process is very similar to selecting a vendor or supplier. A DAO is however superior in many respects to a traditional company in the sense that all the decisions it makes are transparent, its finances can be audited by anyone and corruption is impossible.


### Is this just for geeks?

### 这只是为极客准备的吗？

Definitely not. In order to make decisions, token holders will be able to vote using a straightforward interface using Mist, the Ethereum browser. You'll have to be able to install software on your machine, and use what essentially looks and feel like a website. That's it.


### What can the DAO do exactly?

### DAO究竟能做什么？

The DAO can choose a service provider to implement a technology or develop a product, either by sending funds directly or signing a smart contract. The smart contract specifies the terms of the relationship between the DAO and its service provider.

Once a provider has been selected, the DAO can call functions on the service provider smart contract, setting the values of operating parameters which could include, for example, what percentage of each Slock transaction is used to further fund the DAO, or what milestones have to be reached before the service provider receives certain payments.

What parameters are available depend on the service provider's smart contract and could range from a 'hands off' approach to having the DAO hold complete operational control.


### Who can submit proposals to vote on?

### 谁有权提交提议，要求进行投票？

Any Slock token holder.

任何一个Slock代币的持有者。

### How often can the DAO vote on proposals?

### DAO多久对提议进行投票表决？

As often as it wishes to.


### How will votes take place?

### 投票怎样进行？

Version 1 of the DAO will be released at the end of the presale to hold the funds and allow basic voting. The voting will take place via the [official Ethereum GUI wallet](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases), through an automatically generated HTML interface. Version 2 of the DAO (to be released at the launch of the project) will make use a completely customized Dapp accessible via [Mist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgNjs_WaFSc), the official Ethereum Dapp browser.


### How can the DAO protect its funds from ether's volatility?

The Slock DAO can enter into a hedging contract to protect its funds from ether's volatility. This contract could be provided by a third party. Slock.it GmbH intends to submit a proposal on hedging to the DAO at the end of the presale.


### Why doesn't Slock.it GmbH raise money through a direct crowdsale instead?

Because we believe DAOs are the future of how businesses will be structured. A DAO will provide much greater security and transparency than a traditional presale as investors will stay in control of the funds even after the presale has ended. DAOs also bring about open governance by allowing any Slock token holder to vote on all major business decisions.

*Note: the following section of the document is technical and covers advanced topics that originate from Vitalik Buterin's blog post on [The Subjectivity / Exploitability Tradeoff](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/02/14/subjectivity).*

### What's a 51% attack, and how do you prevent it?

### 什么是51%攻击，你们如何阻止51%攻击？

If someone was to acquire 51% of the Slock tokens, they could vote themselves as the service provider, and then send 100% of the funds to their own account. In order to prevent this, the Slock DAO is able to split itself proportionally to the vote results, leaving the attacker with their funds and the rest of the  participants with their own. Because of this mechanism, there is no incentive to run such an attack, since it is not only unprofitable, but the attacker would also be stuck with worthless tokens from their own fork of the DAO.


### Why is there only a single service provider at any given time?

### 为什么在同一时间内Slock只有一家服务提供商？

For safety reasons. In order to prevent a 51% attack, we needed to introduce the rule that the DAO may split up in case there is no mutual agreement on a selecting a service provider, which in turn removes any incentive to even attempt to bring about such an attack. Having room for more than a single service provider would negate this failsafe.


### How often can the DAO change service provider?

### DAO多久换一次服务提供商？

At anytime.
任何时候都可以换。


### What is the process for selecting a new service provider?

### 选择一个新的服务提供商的过程是什么？

This takes place in two steps. The first step is a simple vote on keeping the existing service provider or choosing a new one. The second step is a confirmation vote, where the minority, having lost the previous vote but comfortable the winner is indeed not an attacker, can vote alongside the majority in order to avoid splitting the DAO. On the other hand, if the minority does suspects a 51% attack, it's important for it to keep its ability to stick with its decision to split the DAO, effectively rendering any attack unprofitable.
